  <h2>March 23rd 2020</h2>
  <p>This was the first day of online lessons from school and it was a new expirience, I finished way earlier before my normal school time and had extra time to do whatever i wanted.Another good thing about studying from home is that you have your
    parents to help and you also have no detentions or people to distract you.I started reading the book Killer of Men, by Christian Cameron which I highly recommend for young teenagers.I also mixed up my time with a bit of games.</p>
  <h2>March 24th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today I still finished my work early and was thinking about how long this was going to last and when I was going to be able to go out freely today. Then i thought, do I really have to be stuck home with my sister for over 2 months🙏🙏🙏.I
    noticed that my sister got easily bored so I brought down a few board games that we had not used for a long time and played with her. If any of you reading this are stuck at home with an annoying sibling just try to have fun with them or give
    them some attention and set up a daily habit.</p>
  <h2>March 25th 2020</h2>
  <p>If any of you had a specific school day that you hated you will know what I am talking about in this entry. When I settled down to do my homework I remembered that it is Wednesday and I had the most boring lessons and todaay I finished late
    because I could not be asked to do it fast. After I got really bored because I could not play and my sister kept on coming to annoy me so I went with my dad to do some shopping.</p>
  <h2>March 26th 2020</h2>
  <p>For the majority of the day I played Fortnite because I had finished my work early and I found a nice person and we friended each other and played together. This is the good thing about video games, you can find new people to play with when you
    get bored with playing with your friends all the time.Another one of my ideas to cure boredom is to start doing something daily with your parents like watching a series together. Me and my mum are currently watching a series called Psych which is
    a funny thing to watch.</p>
  <h2>March 27th 2020</h2>
  <p>Do you ever get those days when you do not want to get up from bed. This was one of my days and I started my work at 10:00 and miraculously managed to finish on time.We started watching Star Trek which is a very good idea to pass the time and
    have fun at the same time as a family.My mum started to cook new things and if you have the right supplies you could try it too and the first time there is bound to be something wrong however at least you tried.</p>
  <h2>March 28th 2020</h2>
  <p>Finally the weekend comes and I just relaxed in my room read my book which I then later finished and wrote a book review on to pass the time. For the rest of the day we all sat down and watched a movie upuntil dinner and then me and my mum
    watched a episode and I went to bed around 10:30. I woke up in the night and went on my pc which is something that I got in trouble for but I only done it once so I got off easy.</p>
  <h2>March 29th 2020</h2>
  <p>There is nothing to tell about in this day except the food that we ate 👌👌👌👌.Hot dogs.</p>
  <h2>March 30th 2020</h2>
  <p>I had another one of those blank days when you totally forget about whats going on so i started work at 10:30 instead of 9:00 and finished at 3:30. After dinner our Star Trek episode would not work so my dad downloaded some episodes of <a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2033827609?playlistId=tt8111088&ref_=tt_ov_vi">The Mandalorian</a> and they watched the first two whilst I played some Fortnite.</p>
  <h2>March 31st 2020</h2>
  <p>Today is the day when we decided to stop being lazy😂😂😂😂. We set up a daily excersize using a app on my dad's phone.Im not talking about school days anymore due to the fact that the same things happen every day and I get tired of repeating
    myself.Family excersize is essential in these times that you are not moving and you do not need to lose the habit of walking or excersizing.</p>
