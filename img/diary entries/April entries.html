  <h2>April 1st 2020</h2>
  <p>You could call this the best day of my life if you wanted to because I certainly would. Today is the last day of school until the Easter holidays and I am rushing to get my work done and finished. I was really looking forward to two weeks of
    freedom but my parents had something in store for me...They wanted me to read a book and finish it then wright a review on it over the Easter holidays😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.</p>
  <h2>April 2nd 2020</h2>
  <p>I am going to skip through some of the Easter holiday only because we done the same things every day .</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gaming</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Movies</li>
    <li>Board Games</li>
    <li>Writing</li>
    <li>Sleeping</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>April 13th 2020</h2>
  <p>At once when I woke up I went to the living room and my dad was awake so I read about 100 pages of my book and waited for the rest of the house to wake up.After a delicious lunch I went on Fortnite with my cousins and got them two wins. In these
    times it is best to stay in contact with family members and relatives either by phone or by playing games.We started watching Star Wars because we finished The Mandalorian.</p>

  <h2>April 14th 2020</h2>
  <p>I went up to the loft today to bring down my old legos which were in pieces and rebuild them with my sister. This is another great way to stay occupied and have some fun with your siblings however if they do start crushing the legos you might
    have to find something else that you get along with(such as puzzles).We managed to finish three in one day, my sister done one small police buggy and I done a truck and police motorcycle.</p>
  <h2>April 15th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today, as soon as I woke up I took the lego box and started building my lego aeroplane and i finished it by 12:00. After we ate I set to work reading a book so that I could earn my playing time. A good thing to do if you are a child reading this
    is to not stress out your parents because you are all stuck at home and need to give each other some space</p>
  <h2>April 16th 2020</h2>
  <p>The most boring day in all of my quarantine was probably this one due to the fact that I could not touch my lego, could not play, could not use my phone and I had to do work the whole day. I was then forced to go out with my dad and help with
    the shopping.I did not even get to watch TV.And all of this because I stayed five minutes extra on the computer.You see what quarantine can do to your parents.</p>
  <h2>April 17th 2020</h2>
  <p>As I said in my March entry my mum is trying to cook new things and after lunch today she made some muffins which were delicious. I will include the recipe under.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>300 grams of flour</li>
    <li>150 grams of brown sugar</li>
    <li>75 grams of bitter cocoa</li>
    <li>1 cup of seed oil</li>
    <li>1 cup of almond milk</li>
    <li>200 grams of pistachios</li>
    <li>1 sachet of organic yeast</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sift the flour and then pour all the ingridients except the pistachios and yeast.</li>
    <li>Make sure you get a very soft dough to which you can add the crumbled pistachios and the baking powder.</li>
    <li>Place the mixture obtained in the molds and then bake at 180 degrees for about 15 minutes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>April 18th 2020</h2>
  <p>This weekend I finished my second book which was called Tyrant (again by Christian Cameron)and because of that I pleased my parents and got unbanned so I could play and go on my phone.During your time at home you need to please your parents as
    much as possible because they have to cook, clean but most of all they have to deal with you.</p>
  <h2>April 19th 2020</h2>
  <p>Absolutely nothing happened today and I was so bored because we never go out.</p>
  <h2>April 20th 2020</h2>
  <p>I cant believe it but I am happy that the Easter holiday is over and that they are giving us work. This means that more of our time will be gone. I found out about this youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSciGuys">The
      Sci Guys.</a> It is really fun and some of these experiments you can do at home to keep busy with adult supervision. </p>
  <h2>April 21st 2020</h2>
  <p>Today is the Holocaust rememberance day and we totally forgot about it because we were too busy doing absolutely nothing at home. We are all getting so lazy staying at home all day👍👍👍.</p>
  <h2>April 22nd of 2020</h2>
  <p>😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴We kind of all slept upuntil eleven, ate lunch and watched movies for the rest of the day.</p>
  <h2>April 23rd 2020</h2>
  <p>We have finally got to this day.This is the first day that I started web designing, I was an online course on udemy which helped me draft my first website.Udemy is a website that I fully reccomend because it has over 40 selections of courses for
    whatever language you want to learn such as Python,css.html,Bootstrap,Java,Javascript,Scala and C-sharp.</p>
  <h2>April 24th 2020</h2>
  <p>I made my 9 year old cousin really happy today by getting his first win on <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/promotion/mega-sale">Fortnite</a> . This is a very good game and lots of people play it. You can download it on PC, Ps4,
    X-box 1,Nintendo Switch and some phones.You will find out that most of your friends play it in your school.</p>
  <h2>April 25th 2020</h2>
  <p>We found out about a really good app called 50 body workouts and it gives you examples of what to do and the time to rest and then restart.My sister had to finish homework from Friday because she was too lazy and was crying the whole day but she
    still did not want to do it and this became a nightmare to deal with, sometimes we even had to blackmail her.</p>
  <h2>April 26th 2020</h2>
  <p>We got to Season 6 of Psych and it is not getting any worse, my sister started watching it with us and she keeps on calling it Spike no matter how many times we tell her it is wrong.I started to make a Twitch account and stream a bit but it took
    too long so I just went to play some games.My mum wont let me stay awake for long but I always have my PC in my room.</p>
  <h2>April 27th 2020</h2>
  <p>The good thing about playing games is that you meet new people and 1v1 them and that is exactly what happened today.After about 1 hour and a half of reading Igot online and went into random duos and found a guy which i 1v1d and absolutely
    destroyed him.We then became friends, I added him and we played duos together and ended up winning.</p>
  <h2>April 28th 2020</h2>
  <p>My mum made Lasagna today and it was mouth-watering.</p> <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/180820-bookazine-delish-01280-1536610916.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*" alt="">
  <h2>April 29th 2020</h2>
  <p>Every day we watch a movie such as Star Wars or other movies that my mum and dad watched in their day which are pretty fun but my sister and I would rather stay in our room and play games or stay on my phone(my sister is only seven years
    old)🎮🎮🎮🎮🎮🎮.</p>
  <h2>April 30th 2020</h2>
  <p>I started learning the program language css today which is all about making your website look good but I really did not get along with it but in the end I learned it because it is a thing that you will need if you want to be a Web Designer.</p>
