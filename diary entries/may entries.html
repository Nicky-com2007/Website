  <h2>May 1st 2020</h2>
  <p>I started reading the Man in the Iron Mask and it was a 739 page book which will take me a long time to finish.I also found out that 100 pages were missing so I had to download the book on Amazon Kindle and read the rest thereðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š.In the
    night we started watching Star Wars 7 but we could not finish it because it was too late.</p>
  <h2>May 2nd 2020</h2>
  <p>I had to wright the book review of Tyrant which I was reading before The Man in the Iron Mask and was forced to play a board game with my sister otherwise I would not eatðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.I played Fortnite with one of my friends and then all of them
    joined and we played together.Just because you are not going to school does not mean you should not stay in contact eith your driends, if anything you should be talking to them more.</p>
  <h2>May 3rd 2020</h2>
  <p>My sister shares a bunk bed with me and today we decided to use it for something other than sleeping.We hung some blankets and put them on the top bunk making them overlap over the second bunk which covers it completely. We put our phone, books
    and essentials in there and only came out to eat or to got to the toilet.It was super fun.</p>
  <h2>May 4th 2020</h2>
  <p>My sister and I got dragged oon a walk of 3 hours to go to Waitrose and we did not even find what was needed. I got back home and could not feel my legs.We ate a late dinner and went to bed without even watching anything.</p>
  <h2>May 5th 2020</h2>
  <p>We took a break from going out today because yesterday was a bit too much for all of us. We finished watching Star Wars Eight and built a huge lego police boat which my sister then broke because she was not careful enough and dropped it when she
    was pretending it was a flying ship.Then me and my mum watched an episode of Psych and I went to bed . </p>
  <h2>May 6th 2020</h2>
  <p>After a long time stuck at home we finally went to the park alltogether and played some football.My sister enjoyed playing andwhen we came back home she said if we could go again.When going out you can take the massk off if you are twwo meters
    away from everyone around you except the people that you are living with.We started watching Star Wars Nine and finished very late.</p>
  <h2>May 7th 2020</h2>
  <p>My sister has started making breakfast for my parents(she calls it being nice but I call it child slaveryðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)and that is something that you should start to do to your parents because they are probably stressed for your safety because of
    the virus.</p>
  <h2>May 8th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today I started working at 8:30 so that I could finish extra early and I studied some IT and developed the website a bit more.After that I played a game on my phone called <a href="https://smart.link/5b15e2143acd6">Fifa Mobile.</a> </p>
  <h2>May 9th 2020</h2>
  <p>We are now goung for a walk every day bevause my mum feels trapped at home and has enough of my little sister.When we came back I played some Fortnite and my sister stayed to watch because my mum andd dad were watching a series on TV.I finished
    playing around 9:00 in the night.</p>
  <h2>May 10th 2020</h2>
  <p>I am now on intermidiate css and things are getting harder for me. I use sites like <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>to help me with solving errors in code or
    moving the items in our website. </p>
  <h2>May 11th 2020</h2>
  <p>I decided to not annoy my mum today and finish my work without stopping for breaks, this resulted in more of my time going into studying IT and playing Fortnite and I started a new game called Counterstrike and then me and my mum watched an
    episode of Psych.We then decided to watch another one with my sister however it scared her so we finished watching by ourselves.</p>
  <h2>May 12th 2020</h2>
  <p>I have over 40 of these books that I have been collecting in Italian and they are called <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Duck_Avenger">Paperinik</a>and they are really fun, you can also read them in English.We played Star Wars
    monopoly and me and my mum ended up winning by 3 planets. </p>
  <h2>May 13th 2020</h2>
  <p>Every single time I open my curtain my sister hears it and comes in my room to annoy me when I want to spend some time alone, she never leaves me alone and always has an excuse ready.After I finished my work I tried to sneak in my room and play
    a bit in peace but my sister would not let me because she thinks its unfair that I play and she cant even though we have a 6 year gap.</p>
  <h2>May 14th 2020</h2>
  <p>I do not know for how long my dad was awake in the night but I could not wake him up in the morning, I had to do my work and he was snoring whilst I tried to get the computer (which was on the cabinet on top of his bed).We played another game of
    Star Wars Monopoly and we lost badly.</p>
  <h2>My 15th 2020</h2>
  <p>I made a deal with my dad that I would not play Fortnite for a whole week in exchange for a Samsung Note 8</p>

  <h2>May 16th 2020</h2>
  <p>Sometimes I wish my mum would let me buy a lock for my door so that my sister can not interrupt me when I am staying in my room studying or playing.ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’</p>
  <h2>May 17th 2020</h2>
  <p>One of my old babysitters got coronavirus but luckily she recovered and will be getting the tests if she is positive or negative soon.From now to Thursday I can only play on my phone because of the deal that I made with my dad, I believe its
    worth it.</p>
  <h2>May 18th 2020</h2>
  <p>We disc9overed a small meadow near our house that we are going to every day now and I started counting how many steps I do in a day on my phone.After 2 hours I rushed home by myself to play with one of my friends who just started playing
    Fortnite and helped him get a win.He told me that he was ashamed of only starting to play now and wanted me to keep it a secret.</p>
  <h2>May 19th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today I finished with css which is by far the most annoying but useful language yet and I will move to Bootstrap tommorow.Bootstrap is the language most used in coding and is favourited by many people.</p>
  <h2>May 20th 2020</h2>
  <p>My dad wanted me to finish bootstrap quickly so that I could get to design my own website which you are on right now.So I decided not to play games and I completed more than half of the course, I am enjoying Bootstrap a bit more than css but I
    guess I need both of them.</p>
  <h2>May 21st 2020</h2>
  <p>I decided to finish Bootstrap in the morning and then do my schoolwork so that is what I done and my dad was very happy with me so he let me play for 4 hours as a reward.I am going to start the website tommorow and the good thing id if I need
    any help my uncle will help me because he is a web designer.</p>
  <h2>May 22nd 2020</h2>
  <p>It was a lovely sunny day so as soon as we finished studying we packed our bags and went to the meadow.After a couple of hours it started getting windy so we went to a nearby shop to buy some food but all we had was my dads card and it would not
    work so I had to run home grab a wallet and run back.When we all came back home I was exhausted.</p>
  <h2>May 23rd 2020</h2>
  <p>I woke up at 10:00 thinking it was school time but then I realized it was the weekend so I started with my website and we found a video that helped me a lot. The guys channel is called <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD3KVjbb7aq2OiOffuungzw">Dark Code</a> and the good thing about him is that he does not talk too much he just shows you what to do and you understand him perfectly.</p>
  <h2>May 24th 2020</h2>
  <p>My siter had some work that she had to complete but she did not want to so we ended up wasting half a day and had to go out for a walk after dinner which we rarely do.</p>
  <h2>May 25th 2020</h2>
  <p>Half Term has finally arrived and this is a time for great joy because we have no school work for a week however I have to design my website and that is fun so I do not complain.I an glad that my dad pushed me to do this because this could be my
    future job.</p>
  <h2>May 26th 2020</h2>
  <p>My mum made pancakes for the whole family and they were delicious, for the rest of the day all we done was relax and watch some movies with popcorn.</p>

  <h2>May 27th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today I finished reading the Count of Monte Cristo and went on to make my website which I think looks very good for me.I am very proud of what I have done and hopefully you like it.</p>
  <h2>May 28th 2020</h2>
  <p>My mum started complaining about how lazy we are and she almost pulled us by the hair to take us out for a walk.I got to 9000 steps and we ate some rice with chicken for dinner which was spicy and very nice.</p>
  <h2>May 29th 2020</h2>
  <p>Today we met one of my sisters friends on the way to a new park that we wanted to go to. My sister had fun playing with him and I wrote my book review on mt phone.You can find the book reviews in the <a
      href="file:///C:/Web%20Development/Last%20Design/Hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> page of my website.</p>
  <h2>May 30th 2020</h2>
  <p>I started reading the book 1984 by George Orwell which is a very interesting book about a guy who lives in a dystopian world.We went out to the meadow and saw a party going on in the middle with speakers and a generator.</p>
